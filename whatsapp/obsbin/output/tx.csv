DHJTB42 4G All cell down several times since 01/01/2023 to till now due to SW error issue. Today I escalated to RAN BO to upgraded new software version to solve it permanently.
As per RAN BO zakeer vai if we get any SW error issue with old version software then we have to restored by As per RAN BO MOP. After that we have to inform RAN BO, 
That software version of this site is now old version, this has to be upgraded to new software version to solve it permanently.
